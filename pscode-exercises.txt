// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Read the first number (num1) from the user.
Read the second number (num2) from the user.
Calculate the sum of num1 and num2.
Store the result in a variable called sum.
Display the value of sum.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Read the number (num) from the user.
Calculate the remainder of num divided by 2.
If the remainder is equal to 0, then the number is even.
a. Display "The number is even."
Otherwise, the number is odd.
a. Display "The number is odd."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Initialize a variable called sum as 0.
Initialize a variable called smallest with a very large value.
Initialize a variable called largest with a very small value.
Repeat the following steps five times:
a. Read a number (num) from the user.
b. Add num to the sum.
c. If num is smaller than smallest, update the value of smallest to num.
d. If num is larger than largest, update the value of largest to num.
Calculate the average of the five numbers by dividing the sum by 5 and store it in a variable called average.
Display "The average is " concatenated with the value of average.
Display "The smallest number is " concatenated with the value of smallest.
Display "The largest number is " concatenated with the value of largest.
